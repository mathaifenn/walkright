    <p><em>A private reflection space</em></p>

    <p class="quiet">
      This page is a private reflection space following a leadership talk on AI, organizations, and human judgment. It is designed to help you process the ideas presented and consider how they apply to your own context. Nothing here is tracked, stored, or shared. This is not a tool or an assessment.
    </p>

    <h1>Why Most AI Investments Fail to Deliver ROI</h1>
    
    <p class="subtitle"><em>The problem isn't technology—it's organizational clarity.</em></p>

    <p>
      For a brief period in the early 1990s, many organizations believed that their most critical strategic resource was the relationship with the customer. This belief shaped how companies communicated, designed experiences, and imagined value—often striving not just for satisfaction, but for delight. Over time, that relationship was gradually pushed outward: first outsourced to call centres, then constrained by scripts, compliance, and fear of litigation, and eventually replaced altogether by human-like AI agents. What remained was efficiency without ownership, interaction without relationship, and execution without meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This talk reframes the current AI conversation by arguing that the widespread failure of AI investments to deliver ROI cannot be understood in technical terms alone. Long before AI arrived, organizations had already weakened their human core—reducing judgment, agency, and relationship-building in the pursuit of scale and cost optimization. AI now accelerates this trajectory by absorbing execution at unprecedented speed. The strategic question is no longer whether AI works, but what organizations choose to do with the human capacity it frees.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "AI will not determine the future value of your organization.<br/>
      It will only reveal what you chose to protect—and what you chose to give away."
    </blockquote>

        Below is a reflection prompt—a simple text file you can use with any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or others). Copy it, paste it into a conversation, and explore these questions in your own context. Think of it as a guided conversation to help you process what you've heard.
